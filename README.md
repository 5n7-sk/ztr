# ztr

Set tmux window title automatically

## Feature

**ztr** automatically sets the title of tmux window for people to see easily.

1. If you are in a regular directory, ztr sets to that directory name.
2. If you are in a git repository directory, ztr sets to like `{user}/{repository}` (if the directory structure is like ghq or golang).

## Install

```shell
zplugin light skmatz/ztr
```

Same for other plugin managers.
